# Lab 4: Create Job Openings Cards Page

## Introduction

When a hiring manager asks what roles are open, the answer should be easy to browse. In this lab, you will turn open requisitions into a clean job board where each card shows the essentials and Smart Filters help the recruitment team find the right openings quickly.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create a Cards page from open job requisitions.
- Present each opening with department, headcount, opening date, and an icon.
- Add department and headcount filters to narrow the job board.
